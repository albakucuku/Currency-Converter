# Currency-Converter 
// This program uses a function called convertCurrency() to convert the input
// amount from one currency to another. The function takes three arguments: 
// the amount, the currency it is currently in, and the currency to convert it to.
// The function uses a set of predefined conversion rates to convert the amount to
//  US dollars, and then to the desired output currency. The main program prompts 
// the user for the input amount and currencies, calls the convertCurrency() function, and prints the result.
